She decided to start her clothing business in one of the major fashion cities of the world. After doing a lot of research, she narrows her search to two cities: New York and Paris. Both cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries. Sarah thinks the safest way is to compare the neighborhoods of the two cities and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. Then she can get more helpful information to help her make her decision."

The information we want to focus on are shopping venues, coffee shops, and entertainment venues. We will choose one neighborhood from each city: Manhattan for New York and Louvre for Paris. We need to apply Neighborhood Segmentation and Clustering to analyzing the neighborhood data and prioritize the best shopping location in both cities based on foot traffic and type of venues available. Lastly, we can decide which city is the better place for Sarah to start her business."
